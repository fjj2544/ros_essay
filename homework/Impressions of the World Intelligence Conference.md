On May 18th, we collectively participated in the World Artificial Intelligence Conference. The following are the relevant feelings of the conference.

First of all, I think that this time I have gained a lot and I have seen many new technologies, new ideas and new solutions. Explain separately below.

​	I can hardly imagine that a robot can move autonomously under water and avoid obstacles autonomously. The main problems that may be encountered are water flow resistance, visual slam in the water and corresponding waterproof materials. Underwater and land, underwater needs to consider endurance, waterproof motor design, and waterproof architecture.

​	An underwater robot in the form of a drone, in which two blades are driven, ultimately enabling underwater lifting and autonomous movement. A variety of underwater missions are now possible.

# Smart city framework

​	What impressed me the most is the smart city frame design system. This system not only represents our future vision. It also shows the direction we should work hard, and this is the great idea of the future. Let us deeply understand the convenience and happiness brought by the smart city.

​	Through this participation, I have gained a better understanding of robotics and robotics, and let me know the direction in which we can develop in the future.
